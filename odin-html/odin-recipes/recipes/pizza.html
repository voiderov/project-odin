    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, olive oil, salt and the yeast mixture; stir well to combine. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a well-oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough, and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll out into a 12-inch circle. Place on a pizza pan or baking sheet. Add your favorite toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven at 475 degrees F (245 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and cheese is bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
