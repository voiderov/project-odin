        This perfectly pan-seared steak recipe delivers a restaurant-quality crust and a tender, juicy interior with minimal fuss. Use a heavy skillet, high heat, and a quick butter baste for best results.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ribeye or sirloin steaks (10–14 oz each), about 1–1.5" thick</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary or thyme</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove steaks from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking and pat dry. Season generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat a heavy skillet (cast iron preferred) over medium-high heat until very hot. Add olive oil.</li>
        <li>Sear steaks without moving for 3–5 minutes until a deep brown crust forms. Flip and sear the second side 3–4 minutes for medium-rare (adjust for thickness and desired doneness).</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium, add butter, smashed garlic, and herbs. Tilt the pan and spoon the melted butter over the steaks (basting) for 30–60 seconds.</li>
        <li>Transfer steaks to a cutting board and rest for 5 minutes before slicing against the grain and serving.</li>
    </ol>
